# Practical deployment of Generative AI models

Course covering practical aspects of deploying, optimizing, and monitoring Generative AI models. The course is divided into three modules: Deployment, Model Optimization, and Monitoring and Maintenance Deployments.

### Module 1: Deployment

Covers various strategies for deploying Generative AI models starting from local deployment of Generative AI models on a laptop or workstation, followed by on-premise server-based deployments, then edge deployments, before finishing with cloud-based deployments. Cover the pros and cons of each strategy and the factors to consider when choosing a deployment strategy.
